> With five nodes in the Vault cluster distributed between three availability zones, this architecture can withstand the loss of two nodes from within the cluster or the loss of an entire availability zone. If deploying to three availability zones is not possible, the same architecture may be used across two or one availability zones, at the expense of significant reliability risk in case of an availability zone outage.
